   <p>Picturesque Lucerne sits on Lake Lucerne in central Switzerland, framed by snowcapped mountains and medieval buildings. This city's old town is home to historic attractions, lively town squares, boutique shops and old churches. Make sure to see the Musegg Wall and its towers (the preserved fortifications date back to the 13th century) and Europe's oldest wooden covered bridge, the Chapel Bridge, which was originally built in 1333.</p>
